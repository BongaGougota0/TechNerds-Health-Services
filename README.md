"Health services project that connects patients and healthcare workers. The app would allow patients to see when to collect their medications, helping to avoid long queues at clinics. It would also assist nurses and doctors in ordering medications on time and tracking them. For patients without smartphones, the app could send SMS notifications to remind them when to pick up their medications." ~ Vee
